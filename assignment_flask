1. get vs post methods
the most commonly used http methods are get and post.
GET is is used to retrieve data from server, it could be in the form format or json format.
POST method is used to upload data to a server in the form of json file or form format.
the information doesnt involve searching through url.

2. REQUEST in flask is an object that contains all the data from client to server.
this data can be dealt with using GET and POST methods
some previously used methods: request.form, request.method, etc.

3. import redirect
2app.route("")
def function1():
    return redirect("link", code= 000)
redirect() is used to send the user to a particular url with a status code of three digit.
4. Flask provides us the render_template() function which can be used to render the external HTML file to be returned as the response from the view function.
